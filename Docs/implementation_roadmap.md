# DaisyDos Implementation Roadmap & Checklist

## Overview

This roadmap provides both strategic direction and granular implementation tasks. Each task is designed to be completable in a day or less, with clear acceptance criteria. The phased approach ensures architectural validation at each step while building toward a production-ready application.

**Key Architectural Decisions Validated:**
- Apple's Model-View (MV) pattern with @Observable models containing business logic
- Rich domain models replacing traditional Manager-heavy architectures
- Lightweight Service layer for queries and external operations
- Privacy-first approach with local-only mode
- Feature-based organization aligning with SwiftUI's reactive nature

**ðŸ”„ Recent Updates:**
- **Skip System Simplified (Phase 3.4)**: Replaced complex enum-based skip reasons with simple optional string input for better UX and reduced complexity
- **Grace Period System Removed (Phase 3.4)**: Eliminated grace period complexity in favor of simple consecutive day streak tracking
