# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

DaisyDos is a unified iOS productivity application built with SwiftUI that integrates task management and habit tracking. The app targets iOS 17.0+ and uses SwiftData for data persistence with CloudKit integration prepared but disabled by default for privacy.

## Build Commands

This is a standard Xcode project. Use Xcode to build and run:

- **Build**: Cmd+B in Xcode or `xcodebuild build -scheme DaisyDos -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16'`
- **Run**: Cmd+R in Xcode to run on simulator/device
- **Test**: Cmd+U in Xcode or `xcodebuild test -scheme DaisyDos -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16'`
- **Archive**: Product → Archive in Xcode for distribution

### Framework Compatibility Notes

- **PhotoKit**: Not available on iOS Simulator. Code uses conditional import `#if canImport(PhotoKit)` to handle simulator builds
- **EventKit/UserNotifications/CloudKit**: Work on both simulator and device
- **Charts Framework**: Available for habit progress visualization (iOS 16+)

## Architecture Overview

### Core Technologies
- **SwiftUI + SwiftData**: Modern declarative UI with Core Data successor
- **@Observable Pattern**: State management using Swift's @Observable macro
- **CloudKit Foundation**: Configured but disabled by default (local-only mode)
- **iOS 17.0+ Target**: Leverages latest SwiftData and SwiftUI features

### Key Architectural Patterns

**Apple's Model-View (MV) Pattern:**
- Models: @Observable classes with business logic (Task, Habit models + Manager services)
- Views: Pure SwiftUI presentation, no business logic
- Services: Lightweight coordinators for queries and external I/O
- No ViewModels: Business logic lives directly in observable models

**Shared Component Strategy:**
- TaskRowView and HabitRowView designed for maximum reusability
- Components work across different contexts (lists, search, Today view)
- Composition pattern with closure-based actions for flexibility

**Navigation Structure:**
- Tab-based navigation with independent NavigationStack per tab
- NavigationManager @Observable class with separate NavigationPath per tab
- Production TabView with 6 main sections (Today, Tasks, Habits, Logbook, Tags, Settings)

### Core Systems

**Data Layer:**
- SwiftData models: `Task.swift`, `Habit.swift`, `Tag.swift` with full @Model implementation
- Manager services: `TaskManager.swift`, `HabitManager.swift`, `TagManager.swift` with @Observable business logic
- Three-tier error handling: Platform → App → User error transformation
- Privacy-first approach with local-only mode default

**UI Layer:**
- Design system with 8pt grid, WCAG AA colors, liquid glass aesthetic
- Reusable components: `CardView`, `DaisyButton`, `InputField`, `StateViews`
- Full accessibility compliance with VoiceOver support and Dynamic Type scaling
- Performance optimized for large datasets (1000+ items)

## Current Development Status

- ✅ Completed tasks automatically hidden from TasksView

#### ✅ **Technical Implementation**
**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- ✅ Manual Swift filtering (SwiftData #Predicate has issues with optional Date comparisons)
- ✅ @Query-based real-time updates (automatic cross-tab sync)
- ✅ Environment injection of LogbookManager in DaisyDosApp
- ✅ 6-tab navigation: Today, Tasks, Habits, **Logbook**, Tags, Settings

## Key Implementation Principles

### **Critical: Component Consistency**
1. **HabitRowView MUST follow TaskRowView patterns exactly** - This is non-negotiable for Phase 4
2. **Composition over Inheritance** - Use action closures for reusability
3. **Display Mode Support** - .compact, .detailed, .today modes required
4. **Cross-Context Validation** - Must work in HabitsView, Today view, search results

### **Established Patterns (DO NOT CHANGE)**
1. **@Observable First**: Use @Observable pattern throughout, no traditional ViewModels
2. **Privacy by Default**: All features work locally before any cloud integration
3. **Error Handling Excellence**: Three-tier system transforms errors to user-friendly messages
4. **Accessibility Excellence**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with 44pt touch targets
5. **Performance Focus**: Optimized for large datasets with efficient SwiftData queries
6. **SwiftData Patterns**: Use @Query for UI updates, explicit order properties for relationships

### **New Patterns for Phase 3**
1. **Charts Integration**: Use Charts framework for habit progress visualization
2. **Streak Calculations**: Implement simple consecutive day streak logic
3. **Completion Tracking**: Separate HabitCompletion model for individual completion entries
4. **Visual Feedback**: Rich progress indicators and heatmap visualizations
