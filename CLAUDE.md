# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

DaisyDos is a unified iOS productivity application built with SwiftUI that integrates task management and habit tracking. The app targets iOS 17.0+ and uses SwiftData for data persistence with CloudKit integration prepared but disabled by default for privacy.

## Document Navigation

**This document:** Architecture guide and AI assistant quick reference
**For detailed feature checklists:** [implementation_roadmap.md](Docs/implementation_roadmap.md)
**For testing guide:** [TestingGuide.md](DaisyDosTests/Documentation/TestingGuide.md)

## Build Commands

This is a standard Xcode project. Use Xcode to build and run:

- **Build**: Cmd+B in Xcode or `xcodebuild build -scheme DaisyDos -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro'`
- **Run**: Cmd+R in Xcode to run on simulator/device
- **Test**: Cmd+U in Xcode or `xcodebuild test -scheme DaisyDos -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro'`
- **Archive**: Product → Archive in Xcode for distribution

### Testing Policy

**Claude should NOT run tests directly.** Running tests via CLI consumes excessive tokens and time. Instead:

1. **Build only**: After making changes, run `xcodebuild build` to verify compilation succeeds
2. **Leave test execution to the user**: The user will run tests themselves via Xcode (⌘U) or CLI
3. **If tests fail**: The user will report failures, and Claude can help debug specific failing tests

Quick build command:
```bash
xcodebuild build -scheme DaisyDos -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=05C5E451-7DF0-4243-9E28-9B5D6641EC77' 2>&1 | grep -E "(error:|warning:|BUILD)" | head -40
```

### Simulator Destination Notes

When running xcodebuild from CLI, use a specific simulator name. If there are multiple simulators with the same name (different iOS versions), you may need to specify by ID:

```bash
# List available simulators
xcrun simctl list devices available | grep iPhone

# Use specific simulator by ID if name is ambiguous
xcodebuild build -scheme DaisyDos -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=05C5E451-7DF0-4243-9E28-9B5D6641EC77'
```

### Framework Compatibility Notes

- **PhotoKit**: Not available on iOS Simulator. Code uses conditional import `#if canImport(PhotoKit)` to handle simulator builds
- **UserNotifications/CloudKit**: Work on both simulator and device


## Architecture Overview

### Core Technologies
- **SwiftUI + SwiftData**: Modern declarative UI with Core Data successor
- **@Observable Pattern**: State management using Swift's @Observable macro
- **CloudKit Foundation**: Configured but disabled by default (local-only mode)
- **iOS 17.0+ Target**: Leverages latest SwiftData and SwiftUI features
- **SwiftTesting**: Swifts modern testing framework

### Key Architectural Patterns

**Apple's Model-View (MV) Pattern:**
- Models: @Observable classes with business logic (Task, Habit models + Manager services)
- Views: Pure SwiftUI presentation, no business logic
- Services: Lightweight coordinators for queries and external I/O
- No ViewModels: Business logic lives directly in observable models

**Shared Component Strategy:**

Core Philosophy:
- **Composition over inheritance** - Components use action closures instead of environment dependencies for maximum reusability
- **Cross-context validation** - All components work identically across lists, search, detail views, and navigation contexts
- **Single display mode (.compact)** - Focused MVP development, no display mode complexity
- **Pure presentation** - Components receive data and callbacks, contain no business logic

Component Architecture:
- **Row Components**: TaskRowView and HabitRowView follow identical composition patterns with closure-based actions
- **Shared Micro-Components** (`Core/Design/Components/Shared/`): Buttons, Fields, Pickers, Rows, Sections, DetailViews, Layout primitives
- **Tag Components**: TagChipView (full), IconOnlyTagChipView (compact), TagInfoSheet (details)
- All components validated for reusability across multiple contexts and performance-tested with 100+ items

Key Patterns:
- Closure-based action handlers (no environment manager coupling)
- Priority-based background colors, conditional layouts for active vs completed states
- 44pt minimum touch targets, comprehensive VoiceOver support
- Shared metadata indicators (subtasks, attachments, alerts, recurrence)

**Navigation Structure:**

Architecture:
- Tab-based navigation with **independent NavigationStack per tab**
- `NavigationManager` @Observable class with separate `NavigationPath` for each tab
- Tab switching preserves navigation state within each stack
- All tabs injected via `.environment()` at app root for global access

5 Main Tabs:
1. **Today** - Unified daily overview (fully implemented)
2. **Tasks** - Complete task management (fully implemented)
3. **Habits** - Habit tracking with streaks (fully implemented)
4. **Logbook** - Task completion history (fully implemented)
5. **Settings** - App configuration (fully implemented)

Key Files:
- `NavigationManager` (`Core/Navigation/NavigationManager.swift`) - Central navigation coordination
- `TabConfiguration` (`Core/Navigation/TabConfiguration.swift`) - Tab definitions and appearance
- `ContentView` (`App/ContentView.swift`) - TabView with NavigationStack per tab

Navigation Patterns:
- Each tab maintains isolated navigation history
- `navigationManager.pathBinding(for: .tabName)` binds each stack
- Deep linking foundation prepared for future implementation

### Core Systems

**Data Layer:**
- SwiftData models with @Model implementation (Task, Habit, Tag, etc.)
- Manager services with @Observable business logic (TaskManager, HabitManager, TagManager, etc.)
- Three-tier error handling: Platform → App → User error transformation
- Privacy-first: local-only mode by default, CloudKit configured but disabled

**UI Layer:**
- Design system: 8pt grid, WCAG AA accessibility, liquid glass aesthetic
- Reusable component library in `Core/Design/Components/`
- Full VoiceOver support and Dynamic Type scaling throughout
- Performance optimized for large datasets (1000+ items tested)

**Key Patterns:**
- Each feature has `/Models`, `/Views`, `/Services` subdirectories
- Shared components live in `Core/Design/Components/Shared/`
- Tests mirror production structure in `DaisyDosTests/`

## Current Codebase Status

**Completed Systems:**
- ✅ **Task Management** - Full CRUD, subtasks, attachments, recurrence, notifications
- ✅ **Habit Tracking** - Completion tracking, streaks, analytics, notifications
- ✅ **Tag System** - 5-tag per item limit, 30-tag system limit
- ✅ **Logbook** - Tiered retention (90/365 days)
- ✅ **Today View** - Unified task/habit overview
